Description :
=============
You have a cricket team information and you need to sort them based on certain criteria.

Assuming that each Team name is unique, you have to form a leader board

For example

TeamName #Wins #Losses #Draws

England 	4 	2 		3
India 		5 	2 		4
Australia 	6 	2 		3
SouthAfrica 5 	3 		4
Bangladesh 	3 	4 		2
Zimbabwe 	3 	4 		6
Ireland 	3 	4 		1

Sort Criteria:
==============
Sort the teams in descending order based on the attribute Wins. If two teams have same number of wins, then sort them in ascending order based on attribute losses and if two teams have same number of losses then sort them in descending order based on attribute draws.


You were given a Solution class and Team class, Solution class contains sort method which accepts a team array as parameter. Sort the team array based on the above sorting criteria and return a sorted team array.
