Self-organizing search. A self-organizing search algorithm is one that rearranges items to make those that are accessed frequently likely to be found early in the search. Modify your search implementation for a symbol-table that uses an (unordered) array as the underlying data structure to perform the following action on every search hit: move the key-value pair found to the beginning of the list, moving all pairs between the beginning of the list and the vacated position to the right one position. This procedure is called the move-to-front heuristic and expected a linear worst-case solution for the search method.

Test cases: Your code will be tested by unit testing.
